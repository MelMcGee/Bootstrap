# Bootstrap
Repo for CSS and bootstrap.

Get started by viewing the Google Doc shared with you. This holds the example layout.

Although I would like you to try to get as close to you can with the layout.
However, after you have the basic structure completed, if you are inclined, feel free to play with images, fonts, etc. 

I would like you to center items vertically and horizontally as shown in the Google Doc.

Get as far as you can today. Your goal is to learn about how you can combine bootstrap along with your custom CSS. 
Additionally, I'd like you to explore common CSS concerns, like centering divs horizontally and vertically, 
playing with responsive layouts, etc. 

If you need to choose between understanding versus finishing the look and feel, error on the side of understanding CSS and bootstrap.
